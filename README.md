# TheAssembler
Final Project for CMP280 Assembly Langauge

## About
This program was designed by a team of three with the intention of teaching both logic gates and basic assembly language concepts
to new students of CMP280's assembly language class.  It was submitted to ACM's CHI 2013 student game competition (https://chi2013.acm.org/).

## How To Run It
The publish/ folder contains the installation binaries, just download and run setup.  It should start automatically.

## Playing The Game
A critical part of the game is experimentation.  In The Assembler you are a clueless crewmember of a ship which is in the process of breaking down.  You have access to a console with a bunch of circuits that need repairing, and a terminal (broken) with which you can modify ship functions by calling on the functions of the circuits.  A set of registers exists with a few reserved for input/output of external data and controls.  The clock is ticking, so explore and try everything.
